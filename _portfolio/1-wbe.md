title: "Wastewater Surveillance"
excerpt: "My research focuses on advancing wastewater-based epidemiology through the development and optimization of detection methods for emerging pathogens. I conduct *in silico* assay development and wet-lab validation for digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and sequencing-based approaches. My work has directly contributed to improving the current wastewater surveillance system, including the development and validation of a wild-type measles assay applied by multiple health departments in response to recent outbreaks, and continues to expand through bioinformatics and metagenomic applications. <br/><img src='/images/Projects_wbe.jpg'>"
