title: "Wastewater Surveillance"
excerpt: "My research focuses on wastewater-based epidemiology, with an emphasis on developing, validating, and optimizing methods for detecting emerging pathogens. Across multiple projects, I have developed and optimized workflows for pathogen detection using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and sequencing-based approaches. One of my studies developed and validated an assay capable of distinguishing between measles wild-type and vaccine strains in wastewater, which has been applied by several health departments in response to recent outbreaks. I am also using bioinformatics and metagenomic analyses to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of pathogen detection in wastewater. <br/><img src='/images/Projects_wbe.jpg'>"
