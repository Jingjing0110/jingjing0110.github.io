title: "Sustainable Nutrient Management"
excerpt: "My research explores using bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture as a sustainable alternative to advanced wastewater treatment technologies in coastal areas. I developed an integrated framework that combines process modeling, life cycle assessment, and techno-economic analysis to evaluate system feasibility, environmental impacts, and economic performance. This work provides guidance and support for future efforts in sustainable nutrient management and climate resilience. <br/><img src='/images/Projects_sustainable.jpg'>"
