title: "Sustainable Nutrient Management"
excerpt: "My PhD work in sustainable wastewater nutrient management demonstrated the potential economic and environmental benefits of using bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture to substitute advanced wastewater treatment technologies and provided guidance and support for future efforts regarding macroalgae bioextraction. Additionally, my work established a framework that has been used to support further research into nutrient recovery from wastewater and macroalgae-based climate change solutions. <br/><img src='/images/Projects_sustainable.jpg'>"
