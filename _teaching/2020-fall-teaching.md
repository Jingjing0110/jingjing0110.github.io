Drawing on my dissertation research, I designed and taught a specialized module on wastewater treatment simulation using GPS-X Pro. In this project, I guided students to build a dynamic model of a real wastewater treatment plant in Potsdam, NY, using its actual construction and operational data. This hands-on experience bridged the gap between classroom concepts and real-world engineering, enabling students to apply their learning to a practical case study.
