I designed and led workshops on wastewater surveillance for community college students from diverse backgrounds. The curriculum explained how wastewater data tracks community disease transmission, informing public health responses and enabling individuals to make protective health decisions. A key component was an [interactive online simulation tool](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jOWLyYbfHrH-WE3L4uf7HVTqzPPPCjFs?usp=sharing) I developed, which allowed students to explore the key variables and limitations of wastewater surveillance.
