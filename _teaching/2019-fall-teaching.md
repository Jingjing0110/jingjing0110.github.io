As a teaching assistant, I led lab classes and coordinated a tour of the local wastewater treatment plant. My responsibilities also included grading all assignments, reports, and exams. I fostered an open learning environment by encouraging questions and offering flexible one-on-one meetings, providing personalized support to help students achieve their learning objectives.
