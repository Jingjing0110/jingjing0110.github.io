I led a hands-on module where students used GPS-X Lite, a dynamic wastewater treatment simulator, to solve process problems. This experience deepened their understanding of wastewater treatment fundamentals and provided a foundation in process simulation. The skills learned are essential for the advanced modeling, control, and optimization of modern wastewater treatment plants.
