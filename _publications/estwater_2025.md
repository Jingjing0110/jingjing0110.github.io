collection: publications
category: surveillance
permalink: /publication/estwater_2025
excerpt: 'In this research, six concentration methods were compared in terms of sensitivity and cost for the detection of 14 diverse pathogens in wastewater. This study provides data-driven insights to enhance the reliability and cost-effectiveness of wastewater surveillance systems that can support public health responses for a broad range of diseases.'
