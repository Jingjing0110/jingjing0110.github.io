title: "Bioextractive aquaculture as an alternative nutrient management strategy for water resource recovery facilities"
collection: publications
category: nutrient
permalink: /publication/wr_2022
excerpt: 'Based on a case study of a coastal WRRF in Maine, this work integrates wastewater treatment simulation, life cycle assessment, and techno-economic analysis to evaluate seaweed aquaculture as a sustainable alternative to advanced nutrient removal processes. The results indicate that nutrient bioextraction can achieve comparable nitrogen reduction with lower costs and added environmental benefits.'
