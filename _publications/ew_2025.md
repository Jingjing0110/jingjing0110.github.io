title: "Assessment and application of GeneXpert rapid testing for respiratory viruses in school wastewater"
collection: publications
category: surveillance
permalink: /publication/ew_2025
excerpt: 'This study assessed the feasibility of using a PCR rapid test system for monitoring SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV in school wastewater. The findings demonstrate the potential of this rapid testing technology for efficient and cost-effective monitoring of respiratory viruses in facility-level wastewater, particularly for testing lower quantities of samples in resource-constrained areas.'
