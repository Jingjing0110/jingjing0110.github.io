I am a postdoctoral researcher whose work focuses on advancing wastewater as a resource while minimizing economic costs, environmental impacts, and risks to public health. My research sits at the intersection of environmental engineering, microbiology, and public health.

I am broadly interested in wastewater utilization, including wastewater-based epidemiology, energy production, and nutrient recovery. My graduate research centered on sustainable wastewater nutrient management, where I demonstrated the potential of macroalgae cultivation as an alternative to advanced treatment processes. This work highlighted the economic and environmental benefits of bioextractive aquaculture for small wastewater treatment plants.

Currently, my research focuses on developing and optimizing molecular diagnostic methods for wastewater surveillance. I have led projects on pathogen detection assays, method comparisons for monitoring costs and efficiency, and modeling low-level disease trends in wastewater. Through this work, I contribute to national and local surveillance efforts, including serving on the National Wastewater Surveillance System Centers of Excellence (NWSS-CoEs) laboratory working group.

Beyond research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring, and community outreach, and I look forward to continuing to integrate education and service into my career.

# This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

# You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

# A data-driven personal website
# ======
# Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

# Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

# For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
# - [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
# - [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
# - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting

# Add figure

and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
