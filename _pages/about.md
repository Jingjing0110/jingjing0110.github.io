Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice University, working with Dr. Lauren Stadler. Before joining the [Stadlerâ€™s Lab](https://stadler.rice.edu/){:target="_blank"}, I earned my Ph.D. and M.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Clarkson University under the supervision of Dr. Shane Rogers and a B.S. in Biological Science from Ocean University of China. I am dedicated to advancing wastewater as a resource for public health and environmental sustainability. My research explores innovative strategies to reduce the economic, environmental, and health burdens associated with wastewater while enhancing its value as a source of information and nutrients.

Broadly, my work covers wastewater treatment, wastewater-based epidemiology, resource recovery, and sustainable nutrient management. My doctoral research demonstrated the potential of bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture as an alternative to advanced wastewater treatment processes, and my current projects focus on optimizing molecular diagnostic approaches for microbial detection in wastewater.

Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching, mentoring, and community engagement, integrating science and service to create a broader public impact.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting
